# Documentation Rules

When writing or modifying code in this project:

1. Every function and class must have a docstring explaining its purpose
2. Complex logic must include inline comments explaining the reasoning
3. Implementation decisions and trade-offs must be documented
4. Comments should focus on 'why' rather than 'what' the code does
5. Edge cases and potential pitfalls must be documented

## Examples

Good docstring:
```python
def process_marketplace_listing(listing_data: dict) -> ListingModel:
    """Transform raw marketplace listing data into a standardized model.
    
    Handles edge cases like missing prices, malformed titles, and ensures
    consistent data format for database storage.
    
    Args:
        listing_data: Raw dictionary from Facebook Marketplace scraper
        
    Returns:
        ListingModel instance with normalized data
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If required fields are missing or malformed
    """
```

Good implementation comment:
```python
# Using exponential backoff for retries to prevent rate limiting
# Starting at 1s, doubling up to max 32s between attempts
retry_delay = min(2 ** attempt * 1.0, 32.0)
```
