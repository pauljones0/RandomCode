# File Template Rules

When creating new files in this project:

## Python Files

All new Python files (*.py) must include this header:

```python
# Copyright (c) {year}, bethekind
# All rights reserved.
#
# This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the
# LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.

"""{filename}

{description}
"""

# Code starts here...
```

## Examples

Good Python file (`src/fb_marketplace_rss/utils/cache.py`):
```python
# Copyright (c) 2024, bethekind
# All rights reserved.
#
# This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the
# LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.

"""cache.py

Implements caching mechanisms for marketplace listings to prevent duplicate processing
and optimize performance.
"""

from typing import Dict, Any
import time

class ListingCache:
    """Manages temporary storage of processed listings."""
    def __init__(self):
        self._cache: Dict[str, Any] = {}
```

Bad Python file (missing or incomplete header):
```python
"""Just a quick cache implementation."""  # DON'T DO THIS

class ListingCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self._cache = {}
```
