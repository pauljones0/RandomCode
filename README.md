# RandomCode
Bits and pieces of random code that I make from time-to-time.

Brightness.ps1 - Powershell script, runs in the background in task scheduler and constantly updates the brightness of the screen.

Volume.ps1 - I used this to mute my system randomly, as CodeRadio would keep playing and it got overwhelming to have it do so all the time. This uses nircmd.exe to run so make sure you have that installed first. You can choose how many seconds of noise you want and how many second of silence.

Midterm-V3.py -A dictionary lookup program I used for a midterm to find approximations of a medical sentence quickly and efficiently. It didn't involve the whole course and a ton of data cleaning was required, but it works reasonably well.

Handin.py - 7 Shifts coding challenge

Smallprogram1.py - This is me trying to code again. Make small simple things that I know how to make, consistently. I've been crushed by the harder assignments in the later years in my Uni degree and didn't feel like I knew how to code the stuff that I was expected of me, instead scrolling reddit endlessly. This is the first (and hopefully not the last) program that doesn't do much, but allows me to feel accomplished and knowledgable and that I can make things.
